Usage: DreamDaemon <world.dmb> [port] [options]
Run world.dmb on specified port.
Options are:
	-cd path     (working directory (path of world is default))
	-cgi         (run in cgi mode)
	-core        (produce a core dump if DreamDaemon crashes)
	-home path   (top safe directory (also used for ~ paths))
	-invisible   (don't broadcast the world to the BYOND hub)
	-log logfile (send stderr to logfile)
	-logself     (send stderr to world.log)
	-map-threads on/off (enable/disable multi-threading of map operations only)
	-once        (shutdown after users log out)
	-params data (form-url-encoded parameter string)
	-ports range (range of ports that may be used)
	-quiet       (less noise in logfile)
	-safe        (file access in world directory)
	-suid path   (run as owner of file or directory*)
	-suidself    (run as owner of world file*)
	             * DreamDaemon must be run by root (not just suid root)
	-threads on/off (enable/disable all multi-threading)
	-trace       (output a debug trace-log file to help the devs track bugs)
	-trusted     (any file and shell access)
	-ultrasafe   (no file access)
	-unsafe_diag (don't block SIGUSR2 during lengthy I/O operations)

Or: DreamDaemon -version
	             (print the BYOND version and then exit)

DreamDaemon traps the following signals:
	SIGPIPE      (ignore)
	SIGFPE       (ignore)
	SIGTERM      (graceful shutdown)
	SIGUSR1      (reboot world)
	SIGUSR2      (print diagnostics including statistcs and a backtrace)
	SIGSEGV      (print a backtrace and abort)
	SIGBUS       (print a backtrace and abort)
All other signals retain their default behavior for your OS.
